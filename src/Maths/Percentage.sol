/**
 * @title Percentage Calculator Contract.
 * @author [Anthony (fps)](https://github.com/fps8k)
 * @dev  On big projects like Decentralized Finances, it is required
 *       that in some cases, percentages be applied.
 *       In Solidity, this is tricky, because, percentages are in
 *       most cases, linked with decimals, and Solidity doesn't really
 *       go well with decimal numbers.
 *       So the concept of decimal places will apply here.
 *       Decimal places (dp), allow the compiler to multiply the
 *       resulting decimal by the value of the decimal place and thus,
 *       return a whole number that Solidity can work with.
 *
 *       Currently, this contract works only for uints that seek for
 *       whole number percentages of another number, i.e. x% of y,
 *       where x and y are whole numbers greater than 0.
 *
 *       Future PRs might include percentages for ints and `masked
 *       decimals` (decimals multiplied by a certain dp), e.g.
 *       [representing 1.5% as 15% then diving the result by 10]
 *
 *       Modifications are welcomed.
 *
 * @notice Higher dp results to higher accuracy.

     *       is not greater than the denominator [which will lead to
